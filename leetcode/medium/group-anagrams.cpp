// 49. Group Anagrams - LeetCode
// Difficulty: Medium
/*
Can you solve this real interview question? Group Anagrams - Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:

 * There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
 * The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
 * The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= strs.length <= 104
 * 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
